### The UK Food Standards Agency evaluates various establishments across the United Kingdom, and gives them a food hygiene rating. You've been contracted by the editors of a food magazine, Eat Safe, Love, to evaluate some of the ratings data in order to help their journalists and food critics decide where to focus future articles.

### I created 2 instances of the Mongo Client to manipulate the data.

### This was split in to 4 parts:
- Part 1: Database and Jupyter Notebook Set Up
- Part 2: Update the Database
- Part 3: Exploratory Analysis

### In part 3 I had to find:
- Which establishments have a hygiene score equal to 20
- Which establishments in London have a RatingValue greater than or equal to 4
- What are the top 5 establishments with a RatingValue of 5, sorted by lowest hygiene score, nearest to the new restaurant added, "Penang Flavours"
- How many establishments in each Local Authority area have a hygiene score of 0? Sort the results from highest to lowest, and print out the top ten local authority areas.
